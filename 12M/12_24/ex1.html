                <h4>English<br>at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>Since the intent of Ascension Academy is to be the premiere college preparatory education in
                    Amarillo, our middle school program begins this process towards excellence in language
                    arts.<br>Teachers introduce all genres of literature to develop an appreciation and enjoyment of
                    reading, enhancing critical thinking skills through discussion and close reading.<br>Mastering the
                    core elements of grammar improves student writing in preparation for the high school curriculum, as
                    well as for Advanced Placement, SAT, and ACT tests.<br>Such writing includes incorporating embedded
                    quotations from fiction and non-fiction sources.<br>Our department stresses the MLA format as
                    appropriate for each level.<br>Furthermore, emphasizing words in context, along with Greek and Latin
                    roots, builds the vocabulary necessary for success in upper-level courses.<br>Our basic guide for
                    integrating reading, composition, and grammar skills continues to be “Laying the Foundation,” a
                    series of integrated objectives.<br>All teachers have attended seminars given by College Board
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>Our high school English program begins the journey to linguistic excellence encouraged by AP
                    guidelines.<br>Pre-AP 9 and 10 have daily drill in advanced vocabulary, as well as emphasis on the
                    manipulation of phrases, clauses, and other stylistic techniques.<br>Literary research papers
                    combine primary and secondary sources with embedded quotations and citations.<br>Teachers present a
                    wide range of World Literature, both classical and modern.<br>Continued use of “Laying the
                    Foundations,” integrates the linguistic and literary elements smoothly.<br>AP English 3 offers
                    students not only an overview of significant American literary works, but also emphasizes the study
                    of the art of rhetoric.<br>To that end, students will be working towards an understanding of how to
                    analyze and craft well-developed, well-supported and persuasive arguments in their own
                    writing.<br>Writing assignments and projects will be varied and will enable students to develop
                    proficiency in the narrative, expository, argumentative, and persuasive modes.<br>Reading will
                    include essays, novels, short stories, poetry, and personal narratives.<br>Seniors in AP English 4
                    have experiences in both British and European literature.<br>The teacher encourages analysis through
                    journals and creative projects.<br>The curriculum also includes student essays, both process and
                    timed.<br>Research will center around the argumentative essay and the literary essay.<br>A daily
                    study of allusions continues to expand the critical reading process.<br>Review of rhetorical
                    techniques encourages success on the two English AP exams.</p>
                <h4>Foreign Language at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>The study of varied languages and cultures is a vital part of Ascension Academy’s mission to provide
                    a comprehensive and rigorous education for its students.<br><br> As the 16th century English
                    humanist and educator Roger Ascham observed, “As a hawk flieth not high with one wing, even so a man
                    reacheth not to excellence with one tongue.”</p>
                <p>Ascension seeks to expand the intellectual horizons of its students by offering a variety of
                    opportunities to acquire the essential skills of oral and written communication in a foreign
                    language.<br>Currently, incoming 6th grade students are required to take two years of Latin (Latin
                    1/2A and 1/2B) as a foundation for their explorations.<br>Students may then choose to continue their
                    study of Latin and/or move into the study of Spanish.<br>In either language, Ascension students may
                    extend their studies of the language, literature, and culture into the Advanced Placement level.</p>
                <h4>Social Studies at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>Ascension Academy offers college prep social studies with the intention of opening up a window to the
                    world for our students.<br>Sixth graders begin by looking at the world at large in an interesting
                    and helpful examination of the major features that go into understanding geography, then apply what
                    they’ve learned in the second semester with a look at Texas history. The seventh graders will take a
                    basic look at American history, and move on to world civilizations as eighth graders.<br>World
                    history will come in two parts - ancient times through the Renaissance in grade 8, and in grade 9 -
                    the modern world of the last 4 centuries.<br>It is our intention to study the geography of the world
                    in greater depth plus the politics, religions, and general cultures found in the world.</p>
                <p>The next two years are reserved for advanced placement courses in American history.<br>The sophomore
                    year will get a look at the origins of the United States through the Civil War.<br>The juniors will
                    study modern America from that time.<br>Again this study will include geography as well as a variety
                    of different looks at the complexities of American history.<br>Finally the seniors will take
                    American government in the first semester and economics in the second semester.</p>
                <h4>Mathematics at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>The mathematics department at Ascension Academy is dedicated to helping students build a strong
                    foundation in the concepts and skills necessary to be successful in both pure and applied
                    mathematics.<br>Students are challenged to think and work independently as well as collaboratively
                    with fellow classmates.</p>
                <p>Middle school students strengthen their basic computation skills and begin to create a foundation
                    based on numeric and algebraic operations and number theory.<br>They are introduced to functions and
                    various graphing techniques.<br>High school students continue function manipulations and learn to
                    solve higher order functions.<br>The rigor of our mathematics program gives students the ability to
                    handle the calculations needed in college prep courses in chemistry and physics.</p>
                <p>The ultimate goal of the mathematics department is to offer a curriculum that enables students the
                    ability to work successfully in upper level pre-AP and AP level courses.<br>Students also have the
                    opportunity to qualify for Dual-credit courses through Amarillo College, thus earning valuable
                    credits recognized in many Texas colleges and universities.</p>
                <h4>Science at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>The study of life through the methods and discoveries of science helps students develop an informed
                    view of the mechanisms that govern the natural world and the processes that continue to shape our
                    universe.<br>Science encourages students to develop their powers of observation while challenging
                    them to apply their best reasoning in analyzing the kind of data that leads to discovery and
                    invention.</p>
                <p>All students at Ascension Academy are enrolled in science classes each year.</p>
                <p>Middle school students move sequentially through earth science, then life science, and finally
                    physical science.<br>The classes are designed to challenge students and prepare them for more the
                    detailed and rigorous high school science classes they will be required to take at Ascension.</p>
                <p>High School students are immersed into our pre-AP science curriculum that prepares them for AP
                    Biology in grade 12.<br><br> Students begin with biology in grade 9, followed by chemistry in grade
                    10, and physics in grade 11 leading up to their senior AP course.<br>Laboratory experience is
                    critical to student learning, and Ascension students enjoy double-period length labs in chemistry,
                    physics and AP biology each week.</p>
                <h4>Religion at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>Ascension Academy’s mission directs the school to create “a safe, nurturing, faith-affirming
                    environment” for young people to learn and grow.<br><br> From its origins the school has made it a
                    priority to foster a school culture where students may deepen their faith while learning to respect
                    and appreciate people of faiths different from their own.<br>How does this school do this?</p>
                <p>Ascension requires all students to select from one of three specific religious tracks for classroom
                    instruction in Catholicism, Protestantism, or Global Religions.<br>These are offered at both the
                    middle and high school levels, with age-appropriate lessons in all three tracks.<br>Religion classes
                    meet three days each week with teachers from those respective traditions guiding students to a
                    deeper understanding of their faith, with emphasis on mastery of religious content and formation of
                    a deeper spirituality.</p>
                <p>Weekly mandatory chapels supplement the classroom by reinforcing faith through the bi-weekly
                    celebration of the mass at St. Thomas Church (for our Catholic students) and assemblies led by
                    special guests of the Protestant faiths (for the rest of our students).<br>On the other two Tuesdays
                    of the month, Dr. Summerhill leads the middle and high school in interfaith chapels focusing on how
                    the transcendent intersects with the everyday issues of our lives.<br>An underlying question put to
                    students in these chapels is, “how can we live together in a community where respect and justice
                    prevail?”</p>
                <p>Ascension Academy has created a rather unique blend of the particular with the ecumenical with the
                    overall goal of helping students deepen their faith while finding that common ground necessary to
                    live in an increasingly diverse human population.<br>Ascension graduates gain a real-life experience
                    in discovering how respect and understanding offer the best hope for the future of the human race.

                <h4>Technology at Ascension Academy</h4>
                <p>Twenty-first century children have lived their entire lives in a technological universe.<br>Their
                    familiarity with computers, ipods, cell phones and the myriad<br>programs and applications that come
                    with these devices is second nature to them.<br>Yet while young people can surf and tweet and text
                    and play games, they do not always understand how to use their technological tools to write, do
                    research, and make presentations.</p>
                <p>Ascension students in the formative middle school years are taught how to use those programs that
                    will be essential in their academic work.<br>Keyboarding, word processing, internet navigation,
                    power point, data bases and spreadsheets:<br>these form the core of a curriculum that stresses both
                    the what and how of effective and proper use of technology.</p>
                <p>The school is equipped with two computer labs in addition to having desktop computers in the library
                    and in each classroom.<br>The Gale Online library is accessible to all students via the internet
                    through the school’s website, making available to them an extensive research library of primary and
                    secondary sources.</p>
